          <p className="text-muted-foreground">National Institute of Technology Patna is the 18th National Institute of
Technology created by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government
of India, after rechristening the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering, Patna, on
28.01.2004. NIT Patna traces its humble beginnings back to 1886 with the
establishment of the Pleadersâ€™ Survey Training School, which was subsequently
upgraded to the Bihar College of Engineering, Patna, in 1924. This made the
institute the sixth oldest engineering institute in India. The graduate-level curriculum
was later elevated to the postgraduate level in 1978.</p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">The institute is situated on the southern bank of the holy river Ganges, behind
Gandhi Ghat, one of the most important and reverential places in Patna. Gandhi
Ghat is associated with the immersion of the ashes of the Father of the Nation,
Mahatma Gandhi, in the river Ganges. The campus has a picturesque river view with
historic buildings presenting a spectacle of architectural delight and natural beauty.</p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">National Institute of Technology Patna has been declared an Institute of
National Importance, as given in the NIT Act, and has been granted fully
autonomous status by the MoE (previously MHRD), Government of India. The
institute has also been declared a Centre of Excellence for imparting high-level
education, training, research, and development in science, engineering, technology,
and humanities. It imparts high-quality education and values at UG (B.Tech), PG
(M.Tech), and Ph.D. programmes through its experienced faculty, well versed in their
respective fields of engineering and technology, with well-equipped laboratories.</p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">At present NIT Patna has ten Engineering Departments, viz., Applied Physics
&amp; Materials Engineering, Architecture &amp; Planning, Chemical Science &amp; Technology,
Civil Engineering, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering, Mathematics &amp; Computing Technology,
Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics &amp; Automation Engineering along with
Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Department. </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">The National Institute of Technology Patna aims to set very high educational
standards and holds a long record of academic excellence. The pedagogical
framework has been designed not only to meet contemporary industrial requirements
but also to develop human potential to its fullest in a wide range of professions.
Extracurricular activities are organized through games and sports, cultural
programmes, and NSS activities. Cultural events provide a platform to learn about
the diverse cultures of various states and regions of the country and serve as
opportunities for national integration.</p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">Since its rechristening, NIT Patna has been on the fast track of development
and has undergone numerous transformations, resulting in remarkable growth in
placements. The placement record has been witnessing unprecedented progress
and is reaching new heights as the graph continues to rise significantly. </p>
